## Welcome to Crypto JBro's Blog

I see crypto and decentralization tech as leading parts of our emerging space society.  Is that dramatic enough for you?  Everyone needs to be learning about this stuff and that's what I love to do.

I've been building websites since 2009 and am now obsessed with blockchain and decentralized tech since stumbling onto it in 2017.  I feel I am able to boil down these techy topics into "normal people speak".  So, that's what I do with my Youtube videos and newsletter.

These changes in global technology and society are becoming more rapid.  I want us to learn together so we don't get left behind.  Please leave a comment or question on one of my Youtube vids since that's the only place I respond.

It is time we all embrace crypto and distributred systems.
